//What is a binary Heap?

// Very similar to a Binary Search Tree, but some different rules.

// In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are alawys larger than child nodes.

//          no order is necessary

// In MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.

// In binary heaps, it's as compacted as possible. Not those super long 1 leg trees.
